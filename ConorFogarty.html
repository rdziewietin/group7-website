<p>My name is Conor. I grew up in the North Shore of Massachusetts and currently attend University of Massachusetts Amherst, studying informatics with a data science concentration.</p>
  <h2> Resume </h2> 
  <h3> Work Experience </h3> 
  <p> Accounts Payable Intern (Dec. 22 - Feb. 23) : Over the six week break from University, I was able to acclimate myself and provide value to the accounts payable division of Pendar Technologies. Although I have worked for this company before and have become familiar with its ERP system, Costpoint, I have never previously worked in Accounts payable. I was able to quickly fit into this role, working with both vendors and internal positions to properly reconcile invoices, internal purchase requests, and internal purchase orders using our three- point voucher system. When issues arose when matching these entities I correspondence with both fellow employees and outside vendors to verify invoices. </p>
  <p> Finance Intern (Dec. 21 - Jan. 22) : As I returned to Pendar as a Finance Intern for the end of 2021 and the beginning of 2022, Pendar was notified that it would be undergoing a post-contract audit by the United States government. I was given the responsibility of implementing Project Phoenix, a project designed to bring a ledger of invoices and internal part numbers regarding the electrical boards and components of the Pendar X10 into a single project in order to be uploaded into the EPR system, Costpoint, in preparation for this audit. I was also given the responsibility to organize and upload into Costpoint all packing slips received in 2021 in order to prepare for this audit. I went on to teach all employees of the company how to upload these packing slips into Costpoint in order to lift to the burden off of the Financial department.
  <p> Production Intern (May 21 - August 21) : Pendar is a start-up defensive contractor in Cambridge, Massachusetts first founded in 2005 then home to roughly thirty employees, majority of which held doctorates in chemistry and engineering, advised by Federico Capasso, inventor of the Quantum Cascade Laser, and founded by renowned entrepreneur Daryoosh Vakhshoori. I worked directly under Joshua Mandelbaum, mechanical engineer and production manager, revising, editing, and creating work instructions for new and current technicians, assisting in the smooth operation of the production of the Pendar X10, and working myself in production creating various components of the X10. In the later half of my summer internship I worked under Tobias Mansuriper, Harvard PH.D graduate of Physics, in the design, sourcing of materials, and construction of a thirty thousand dollar conference room with the intention of housing both internal meetings of executives within the company and hosting of domestic, and foreign government entities interested in pursing business with Pendar. </p>
