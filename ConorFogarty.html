  <h2> Resume </h2> 
  <h3> Work Experience </h3> 
  <p> Finance Intern : As I returned to Pendar as a Finance Intern for the end of 2021 and the beginning of 2022, Pendar was notified that it would be undergoing a post-contract audit by the United States government. I was given the responsibility of implementing Project Phoenix, a project designed to bring a ledger of invoices and internal part numbers regarding the electrical boards and components of the Pendar X10 into a single project in order to be uploaded into the EPR system, Costpoint, in preparation for this audit. I was also given the responsibility to organize and upload into Costpoint all packing slips received in 2021 in order to prepare for this audit. I went on to teach all employees of the company how to upload these packing slips into Costpoint in order to lift to the burden off of the Financial department.
