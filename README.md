# group7-website

UMass Amherst Info 101 group project:

If you are not someone in this class, teacher or student, this is not for you and will be made private on GitHub soon.

For the graders, our website is pretty standard. index.html is the main page and our website is the html file with our name on it. Robin's page, Andrew's page, and the main page all have css files associated with them. 

It opens on the main page and you can click each link to go to our respective pages. At the top of all of our pages is a nav section allowing you to go back to the main page. All navigation can be done in site.

The link to our site is: https://rdziewietin.github.io/group7-website/

It should be accessible normally through the internet, set up the way we intended.
